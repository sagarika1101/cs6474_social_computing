Lately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.

The second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.

I've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.

I don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.

On top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!

So all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.

I live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.

So, here we are. For the past two paychecks, I've been dead broke, paying bills. I still have to pay 300$ to my ex, 200$ to my credit card, 100$ this month for bills, and then yesterday i got four tickets, two in my moms name, and two in my aunts, for stuff I couldn't take care of at the beginning of the month. Grass, because I had no mower, and trash because people keep running over my trash cans. So I have no idea what im going to do about those yet. I'll probably have to end up paying them. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's my turn to cook for myself, and my two friends who are living with me trying to help me keep the place clean.

TL;DR. Got 99 problems, but paying back a nice favor ain't one. Or Have ridiculous bills to pay, city is fucking me over with four tickets for two offenses that I corrected weeks ago, and it's my turn to provide food, but all I have left to cook is ramen, and a dollar bill.

I have no extra money, was not able to buy them a cake or even a cake mix to make them one.

I know I am asking a lot but a pizza would be great, and if I get one I will pay it forward on January 25th when I get paid.

Thank you for reading this.

Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to.

Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me.

I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.

I'm not exactly a charity case (at least not yet) but I was planning on using that $50 for food, now it's going to a stinking overdraft fee instead. I work part time at a local church doing clean ups every Tuesday and Friday. It's not my main job but it helps out a whole lot. The problem is they pay me with these checks that are uncashable, they have to be deposited into an account. I have an ebanking account with Bank of America, every time I deposit a check I get charged a service fee at the end of the month. Well, guess what hit my bank last night? A couple service fees and an overdraft fee for good measure, just wonderful. So my account went from a positive few cents yesterday to negative $56 dollars today. Even when I put in my check I'll be overdrawn anyway, and if I can't come up with the difference they'll hit me for another $35 in a couple days.

They told me that overdraft protection would stop this kind of thing, but of coarse it doesn't do a thing against their fees so getting them removed isn't happening. I'm just glad I filled up my car the other night or I wouldn't have wheels next week. I get paid next Friday and thankfully my Mom is gonna send me some money in a couple days but I'm empty stomached between now and then. Would anybody mind tossing a pizza and some soda my way to tide me over? You'd earn a spot in my prayers tomorrow for sure. I'm just tired of life dumping on me, so if anyone would cut me a break I'd love you forever.","It's 10/30, posted this up yesterday, seems I'm pretty popular on here.

See, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on Oct 5th. This is such shit! We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are ""left"" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes.

So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.

Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

I don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life.

He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward.

**Edit**: We're in Texas! :)","I'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy. He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward.

2654,N/A,False,3,4,0,t3_ktf2k,3,"New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.

 I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.

I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.

My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?

Since I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.

So that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that. Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)","New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone.

I have 89 cents to my name until who-knows-when. Unfortunately where I live, there are no places that deliver. Since my car's broken, I'm not sure I could even do pizza. I was thinking, if I could find the cash, I would walk to the nearest gas station and stock up on pasta-type stuff.
